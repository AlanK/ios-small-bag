# An iOS Small Bag

You never know when opportunity (or disaster) will strike. It’s a good idea to keep a small bag packed, just in case.

An iOS small bag is a a collection of useful extensions and types that would be sure to save you time and heartburn on your next project. Everyone's small bag is sure to be different, but everyone has one (or should think about packing one). There are only a few rules:

1. __It’s gotta be small.__ Your small bag should be one file, and probably no more than a few hundred lines. It needs to be something you could drop into almost any project without pods or dependencies or whatever.
2. __It better work.__ The code in your small bag is code you trust. Experimental or finicky code isn’t what you want to rely on (or what you want to foist on your team) when the chips are down or a deadline is looming.
3. __It has a history.__ Some of my best tools are hand-me-downs. If something in your small bag was gifted or inspired by another developer, give them a shout-out in the documentation. You have documentation in your small bag, right?
